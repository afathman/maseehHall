		  <h3><span class="color">Jack</span> Caroll</h3>
<p>Jack grew up in suburban New Jersey (quiet), went to military high school in Manhattan (exciting city!), and to college in northern Vermont (beautiful, cold winters) and in Rome, Italy (fantastic!).He received a Masters from the University of Chicago in Social Sciences and a PhD from Cornell University in Experimental Psychology. His thesis research was on how comprehension of non-literal communications (e.g., sarcasm, irony) develops from young children through adults – the communications that Sheldon (Big Bang Theory) seems to find so unintuitive. After a stint on the psychology faculty at Northeastern University, he worked for several research companies providing market research and user-centered design services to a wide range of clients. He founded and led a research company that helped major banks and investment companies develop innovative, user-centered online, voice, and kiosk-based interfaces. His interest in helping to establish Maseeh Hall emerges from an unforgettable experience as an undergraduate in Rome, where he learned that an educational community committed to enabling active and varied engagement with a diverse world can create a transformative life experience. He’s happy to help with brainstorming, planning, and launching any new activity for Maseeh, exploring international education/intern opportunities, starting a discussion club on lots of topics, talking sports (soccer and football in particular) over dinner, cheering on Maseeh IM teams, etc. </p>

			<h2>International <span class="color"><a id="international">Fellows</a></span></h2>
			
			<p>“MIT is an international organization, and that should be reflected at every level.” 
Suzanne Flynn, Housemaster
Maseeh Hall strives to foster and promote a diverse and welcoming community, building on the individual strengths of its members. In order to help students make the most of their college experience, broaden their horizons, and emphasize international programming, in 2012-2013 Maseeh Hall will be taking part in a pilot program run by the Division of Student Life to have International Fellows living in the House.
International Fellows are graduate students and resources to anyone with interests or concerns regarding international matters. From international students trying to navigate MIT and the US for the first time, to domestic students with international backgrounds, or students seeking international experiences - International Fellows are Maseeh’s in-house resource for all things international. They assist the Housemasters and House team in building and maintaining relationships with internationally- and multiculturally-oriented offices on campus, as well as partner institutions abroad, and serve as coordinators of international programing within Maseeh Hall.
</p>
<p>The International Fellows are also resources for the students more generally. As with the GRTs, International Fellows are point persons, sounding boards, and providers of support for whatever challenges and issues Maseeh residents may face during their time at MIT.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Germany, I spent time living in New Zealand, England, Scotland, and Japan, before coming to MIT in 2010. I have a Bachelor and Master’s degree in Cultural Studies, which means something like “trying to understand the world.” It comes with limitless complexity and the realization that everything is connected to everything else at the same time. I get dizzy just thinking about it, which is probably why I appreciate the simple things in life, such as: eating, sleeping, reading, and traveling. From ballroom dance instructor to barkeeper - there aren’t many jobs I haven’t had (although an opportunity in a meat processing plant many years ago did not come to fruition, for better or worse).
I’m pursuing a PhD in the History, Theory & Criticism (HTC) of Architecture and Art, with interest in material culture and post-war Japanese urbanism. I’ve also done research on cyborg representations in anime, and am generally interested in the expressive capacities of images.
I’d love to be a resource for all of you who are into text-, image- or cake-making. Also talk to me if you find that everything in the world is limitlessly complex and puzzling... chances are that I’ll have just the right food to console you.</p>

<p>Things I can help with: Humanities, Writing, LGBT, International questions</p>

<h4>Email: kvilla (at) mit.edu</h4>

<p>I grew up in the great state of New Jersey (but not too close to the shore) and went to college at Johns Hopkins in B-more. In college I was a member of Habitat for Humanity, played Taekwondo, and did research on gene expression in fruit flies. After graduation I worked at a pharmaceutical company for one year, where I started to become more interested in Neuroscience research. Now at MIT, I am working to earn my PhD in the lab of Elly Nedivi at the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory. We study many different genes that facilitate learning and memory in neurons. I am currently in my third year of the PhD program in Biology.
I would be comfortable helping out with any general biology, Genetics, Biochem or Neuroscience questions! Also, if you are thinking about medical school vs. graduate school I would be happy to offer advice because I also considered going to med school at some points in my life, and I have many friends who have chosen that path instead of grad school.</p>
<p>My real passions in life are movies, fantasy books, and food (to cook and especially to eat). I would love to meet you all so always feel free to stop by the Underground for a chat!</p>

<p>I grew up all over the place: born by the Pacific coast in Guatemala, studied high school in Italy and went to college at Princeton. Currently at MIT, I'm doing research towards a PhD degree in Biology. 
My academic training has been primarily in Systems Biology, both experimental and computational. 
Currently at the labs of Alexander van Oudenaarden and Harvey Lodish, my thesis work involves uncovering roles of long noncoding RNAs in red blood cell development.</p>

<p>I've also adventured in the study of art history, film and gender theory throughout my academic career. 
Apart from science, I'm also passionate about travel, community service and a lot of other fun stuff playing chess, making or watching movies and trying out new cuisines and dishes: nothing like a combo of these for taking a break from study and getting to know people.</p>

<p>I was born in Russia (St. Petersburg), grew up in France (Paris), went to college in Texas (University of Texas at Arlington), and worked in California (Applications Engineer at International Rectifier in Los Angeles) before coming to Massachusetts (MIT) for graduate studies in the Electrical Engineering department in the Optical and Quantum Communications group. Outside of my field of study, I have a variety of interests ranging from arts and literature (in addition to a BS in EE, I have a BA in French literature) to physical activities like hiking, running and yoga, to relaxing activities like playing guitar badly and singing along and drawing portraits, to travelling (which unfortunately I don’t have as much time for as I would like) and many more … Most importantly I love meeting new people and sharing experiences with them, over a nice meal in conversation, or on the field in action :) I speak three languages fluently (Russian, French and English) and I hope to learn more so that I can continue to expand my understanding of our global community and promote peaceful and happy coexistence. </p>

<p>I am a native of Texas who spent more than a few childhood vacations building low-income housing for Habitat for Humanity on the Mississippi delta and border towns of Mexico. At fifteen, I worked with a German chef eventually graduating from the Culinary Institute of America in New York. My love of cooking and travel took me around the world from South East Asia to Europe and back to North America. I pursued a degree in product design at Art Center College of Design in California. Since graduation I’ve worked with start-ups and think tanks on projects from toys to medical devices. Over the past six years I created and taught an applied arts and science project-based curriculum for junior high and high school students. I look forward to being a resource for students who want to make stuff. I also enjoy discussing history, economics, conservation, public and folk art.</p>

<p>I’m a proud Southern Californian, born and raised in Los Angeles. I recently completed my undergraduate at MIT in 6-2 (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) and now I am currently in my first year at Sloan in the MBA program. While there’s no explicit research component for business school, my interests lie in a number of fields from operations management to corporate behavior and ethics. I’ve had a number of experiences in consulting as well as industry and love discussions about how the business world can adequately adapt to emerging technologies. Outside of the classroom, I’m passionate about music (from classical to R&B) and sports (NBA!) and love to spend time playing board games, starting a pickup game of volleyball, dancing, enjoying good food or just relaxing at home watching TV (Modern Family, How I Met Your Mother, Desperate Housewives and many more). </p>

<p>Hello!  Hailing from sunny South Florida I moved up to Boston in 2004 and graduated from Harvard College in 2008 with a degree in Biology and minor in Psychology. During college I focused on Neuroscience and Marine Biology, working in both a Marine Biology lab with field work in Bermuda and a Neuroscience lab at Harvard Medical School.  After graduation I worked in a Neuroscience lab at Harvard and I am currently working towards my PhD in Course 9, Brain and Cognitive Sciences (Systems Neuroscience) at MIT.  I am a proud member of the Bear lab (a bear cub, as we are called) and broadly speaking, my research focuses on the synaptic pathophysiology of Autism.</p>
<p>I live by an “I’ll try everything once” motto, which has led to some exciting adventures such as sky diving and hiking part of the Appalachian Trail.  I’m a huge sports fan (sorry, my ties to South Florida are strong- Go Heat!) and in my free time I enjoy baking, karaoke, scuba diving, playing water polo and attending Boston Symphony Orchestra concerts.  I’m very excited to be a part of the Maseeh family and look forward to meeting everyone so stop by and say hello!  I’m happy to help with: Neuroscience, Biology and Psychology.</p>

<p>Although I was born and raised in New York City, I've spent the last 6 years living in the Boston area; I did my undergrad at Harvard, and I am now a third year PhD student in the MIT Economics Department. While I’m always happy to help with economics or statistics-related questions, I also enjoy swimming, yoga, and taking pottery classes at the Student Art Association, where I've succeeded in making lots of wobbly cups. I am not an avid baseball fan, so don't worry about having Red Sox/Yankees arguments with me, but I do enjoy (watching) soccer. </p>
<p>My newest hobby is cooking -- something I discovered as a grad student -- so I welcome any recipe suggestions or help from fellow amateur chefs. I'm also a big fan of rock music: indie, punk and classic. As an undergraduate, I worked at a radio station (I hosted a 3:30 am show on Wednesday mornings!), but I have since taken a more relaxed approach to the Boston rock scene.</p>

<p>From South Florida. Graduated from MIT for undergrad. Currently a Ph.D. candidate in mechanical engineering. I primarily work on improving the efficiency of power plant components (specifically boilers) and electronics cooling. My near-term goal after graduation is to form a new start-up company based on my current research. As an undergraduate, I ‘UROPed’ most semesters, implemented appropriate technology in rural India as part of D-Lab, and worked two summers in Italy on the design of a new type of power plant through the MISTI program. Some of my interests include travel, invention, language, entrepreneurship, sports (basketball, running)
I speak Italian and organize the language tables and international programs in Maseeh. I can advise students in career choices (grad school, work) after MIT undergrad; the UROP, D-Lab, MISTI experience; energy classes, research, and technology. I enjoyed MIT as an undergraduate and I hope I can assist the residents of Maseeh in making the most out of their experience.</p>

<p>Hi everyone! I am a PhD student in the HASTS (History, Anthropology, and Science, Technology, & Society) Program. My research deals with online sex trafficking, technology, and digital security. At MIT, I am the Exec Chair of Grad Women @ MIT. I am passionate about curriculum building and bridging university living and learning environments.
I graduated from Stanford with degrees in Feminist Studies and Anthropology and am committed to expanding my feminist research beyond academia, to constantly work on improving the communities that students inhabit. Maseeh's overarching goals of fostering a respectful and welcoming academic environment for all students, as well as providing education and empowerment, have deep resonance for the entire MIT community.
I'm originally from Maryland, although I love to travel and have lived in various parts of Southeast Asia. I also enjoy dancing, painting, laughter yoga, neon colors, and avocados. I look forward to learning more about the fabulous residents of Maseeh Hall! </p>

<p>Hello! I am currently a 2nd year MD student in the joint Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology program. My research at MIT focuses on using computational fluid dynamics to model blood flow through coronary artery stents. I went to college at UC Berkeley as a bioengineering major (or course 20 in MIT speak), and I'm originally from the Bay Area as well. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed being a GRT at Maseeh and getting to know my wonderful residents! In my spare time I enjoy playing the piano and guitar, cooking, and playing basketball.</p>
<p>Whether it is help with introductory biology or physics, advice for pre-meds, or life in general, my door is open to anyone who wants to stop by and say hi! And anyone is welcome to jam with me too!</p>

<p>Hailing from Tallahassee, FL, I went 3.5 years into a BS in Mathematics at Florida A&M University before enrolling at MIT to be “normal.” Here, I earned an SB in Mathematics and an SB in Mechanical Engineering focusing on fluids.* As an undergraduate, I had a UROP in microfluidics: moving saline solutions with Alternating Current Electro-Osmotic pumps. Switching to less dense stuff, I developed a numerical model of reactive gas transport mechanisms in a single wafer Atomic Layer Deposition Process for my undergraduate thesis. Currently a 2nd year course 2 grad student, I am studying how bacteria turn wastewater into electricity using microfluidics. Putting the T in GRT, I can tutor 18.0x (did so for 4 years) and help out with 2.00x and anything fluids related. Outside of school I like running, biking, driving and eating. Really, most of my free time is spent thinking about the woman I am madly in love with and engaged to; she is presently finishing grad school at Cornell.</p>

<p>*The common theme here and in all of my job/grad school/fellowship applications is: I love fluids and teaching, which is why I am at MIT and why I am a GRT.</p>

<p>I am a PhD student in History, Anthropology, Science Technology and Society, where I work on technological and industrial history and material culture. Before coming to MIT, I studied textile and fiber science, at Cornell and FIT in New York, both as a scientist working on self-decontaminating surfaces for chemical protective clothing and as a conservator of textile artifacts from ancient Peruvian mummy bundles to gowns of the first ladies at the Smithsonian. 
I enjoy blurring disciplinary boundaries, am fascinated by the inner workings of institutions of higher education, and spend "free time" creating art, cooking and planning to see more of the world. </p>
